# Introduction

This document compares the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) diseases burden for three countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and India. We compare the burden due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (CMNN).

The source data is from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study.
